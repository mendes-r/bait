# BAIT ðŸª¤

## The problem

Let's be honest, when using the terminal, there must be just a handful of directories where we really do some work on.

Instead of typing or looking at the history for the last __cd__ command, why not _catch_ all the most used in a single, and easy to use, space?

Throw the _bait_ and catch what you really need.

## Description

__Bait__ is a small CLI tool that _catches_ the current working directory every time you call the command.

You can review yours _catches_ and jump instantaneously to those directories.

The _catches_ are permanent and not tied to a specific session.
